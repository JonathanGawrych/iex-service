/**
 * This returns an array of effective spread, eligible volume, and price improvement of a stock,
 * by market. Unlike volume-by-venue, this will only return a venue if effective spread is not ‘N/A’.
 * Values are sorted in descending order by effectiveSpread. Lower effectiveSpread and higher
 * priceImprovement values are generally considered optimal.
 *
 * Effective spread is designed to measure marketable orders executed in relation to the market
 * center’s quoted spread and takes into account hidden and midpoint liquidity available at each
 * market center. Effective Spread is calculated by using eligible trade prices recorded to the
 * consolidated tape and comparing those trade prices to the National Best Bid and Offer (“NBBO”)
 * at the time of the execution.
